To address this, we introduce \"positional encodings\" into the input embeddings at the lower portions of both the encoder and decoder stacks. These positional encodings have a dimensionality, similar to the embeddings, allowing them to be combined through summation. There could be many choices of positional encodings, we use following:\n",
